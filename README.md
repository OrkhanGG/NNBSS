# NNBSS
This repository houses the source code for NNBSS.


## Building
In order to compile, you will need to download some thirdparty SDKs. This version is using these SDKs: "WxWidgets v3.1.6", "OpenCV v4.5.5", "SDL2 2.0.20", "ffmpeg ", "CrashRpt 1403" and "Boost 1.78.0".

## Branches
Development takes place primarily in the "development" branch. 
The "stabilisation" branch is used for fixing bugs in the run-up to release, 
and the "release" branch provides stable snapshots of NNBSS engine.

To prepare for a major (feature) release, I (Orkhan Aliyev) may integrate "development" into "stabilisation", 
and then continue fixing bugs in "stabilisation". 
To prepare for a minor (stability) release, individual changes from 'development are integrated directly into "stabilisation".
In each case, when the release is deemed ready, "stabilisation" is integrated to "release".
