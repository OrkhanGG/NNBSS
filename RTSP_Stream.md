#	Usually, RTSP or HTTP protocol is used by the camera to stream video. An example of IP camera streaming URL is as follows:
#   rtsp://192.168.1.64/1

#	Most of the IP cameras have a username and password to access the video. 
#	In such case, the credentials have to be provided in the streaming URL as follows:
# 	rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.64/1
